Here is the structure for Project 3 - Neural Networks
    NeuralNetwork.py
        Contains the neural network class

    Node.py
        Contains the node class used by neural network

    classificationDriver.py
        Contains the driver for classifcation data.
        Must be tuned with respect to the data set wanting to be tested

    regressionDriver.py
        Contains the driver for regression data.
        Must be tuned with respect to the data set wanting to be tested

    network.py
        This is the testing driver we used when the algorithm was being created.
        This file is not well commmented and only existed for testing purposes.

    MLAlgorithms.Utils.Numba.linear_activation.py
        Contains the linear_activation function used for a given node

    MLAlgorithms.Utils.Numba.logistic_activation.py
        Contains the logistic_activation function used for a given node
        
    MLAlgorithms.Utils.OneHotEncoder.py
        Used to encode categorical data
