Block Format:
    Is this okay?

Provide sample outputs from one test set showing performance on your networks. 
Show results for each of the cases where you have no hidden layers, one hidden layer, and two hidden layer
    Put a break in 10-fold
    test for 0, 1, and 2 hidden layer networks

Show a sample model for the smallest of each of your neural network types. 
This will consist of showing the weight matrices with the inputs/outputs of the layer labeled in some way.
    Does this mean a model for each layer or just for the one neural network we have to implement

 Demonstrate and explain how an example is propagated through a two hidden layer network. 
 Besure to show the activations at each layer being calculated correctly.
    Show that we end up going backwards
    Print which node's acivation layer is being called

Demonstrate the weight updates occurring on a two-layer network for each of the layers
    print before and after

Demonstrate the gradient calculation at the output for any one of your networks.
    print gradient

Show the average performance over the ten folds for one of the data sets for each of the types of networks
    Does this mean a print for each layer or just for the one neural network we have to implement
